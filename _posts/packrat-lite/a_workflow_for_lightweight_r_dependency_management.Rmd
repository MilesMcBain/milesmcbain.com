A couple of weeks ago I proudly shared a `drake` pipeline with a colleague along with some basic instructions: "Install R -> clone this repo -> install these packages -> run this file". The code was only weeks old, had maybe 40 recursive dependencies and used only CRAN versions... what could possibly go wrong right?

Well let me tell you it was a catastrophic failure. My colleague is new to R, and I cringed and fretted for his user experience as the code basically blew up on the launchpad, spewing alien error messages the likes of which I had never seen. 

As I dug into his `sessionInfo()` it turned out he had installed Microsoft R Open, which runs an R version and CRAN package versions that are quite behind the current releases. This was somewhat of a relief, but my eyes were now fully opened to what can happen when dependencies are not stated in explicit enough detail. ^[To add insult to injury my colleague is a JS developer with some fairly mad skillz and I proceeded to get schooled on `npm` and how he had just effortlessly deployed a custom-built front end of our geospatial models to production that had over *1500 package dependencies*]

I decided to research dependency management in R for something simple and light that could provide a foolproof end user experience i.e. 'a button' or a one-liner could be run once the repo had been cloned to set up an environment with the exact same package versions I had used in development. I tried: `checkpoint`, `jetpack`, and `packrat` and eventually settled on `packrat`. The rest of this post describes my `packrat` workflow and some of the issues with the other two packages.

## A lightweight packrat workflow

`packrat` was the last thing I tried because I had already tried it a long time ago and found it a struggle - it seemed to want me to place all the source code of all my dependencies under version control(!!!). From reading around online this seems like a common experience - the packrat API is a bit confusing, much of it seems geared toward enterprise-level dependency management, rather than project-level.

It turns out the kind of workflow I was looking for is possible, but you have to deviate from the default options and workflow advertised in the documentation. Here I describe the workflow I used to create [this example repo](https://github.com/milesmcbain/packrat_demo).

### Initialise packrat

In this step we initialise a project-local library which will automatically have packrat installed into it. Crucially we instruct `packrat` to update our `.gitignore` so that the library itself excluded from our repository.

```
packrat::init(infer.dependencies = FALSE,
              options = list(
                vcs.ignore.lib = TRUE,
                vcs.ignore.src = TRUE
              ))

# Initializing packrat project in directory:
# - "~/repos/packrat_demo"
#
# Adding these packages to packrat:
#            _      
#    packrat   0.5.0
#
# Fetching sources for packrat (0.5.0) ... OK (CRAN current)
# Snapshot written to '/home/miles/repos/packrat_demo/packrat/packrat.lock'
# Installing packrat (0.5.0) ... 
#	OK (built source)
# Initialization complete!
# Unloading packages in user library:
# - rmarkdown, lubridate, dplyr, readr, drake, ggplot2
# Packrat mode on. Using library in directory:
# - "~/repos/packrat_demo/packrat/lib"

```

### install.packages

Next we install our packages into local library as we normally would with `install.packages()`. Why did we not let `packrat` do this for us? Installing many libraries at once can take a longish time and can occasionally throw errors we would like to know about or prompts we would like to answer. It's also a nice check to confirm that our dependencies are really what we think they are - i.e. we don't have stray `lib::` or `library(lib)` calls hiding in the code somewhere.

```
install.packages(c('drake', 'readr', 'dplyr', 'lubridate', 'rmarkdown', 'ggplot2'))

# ... installation guff ...

```

At this point we should test our code to make sure it runs without missing dependency errors.

### Snapshot library

In this step we create a metadata file, `packrat.lock`, that records our R version and all the versions of the packages in our project-local library. This is the thing we will check into our git repo so that others can regenerate our environment on their end when they clone it.

```
packrat::snapshot(ignore.stale = TRUE, 
                  snapshot.sources = FALSE,
                  infer.dependencies = FALSE)

## Snapshot written to '/home/miles/repos/packrat_demo/packrat/packrat.lock'
```

In case you are wondering this is a complete list of _recursive dependencies_ - our dependencies' dependencies.

The reason for the non-default argument choices is as follows:
  * `ignore.stale` stops `packrat` from second guessing the us. We are saying just make a metadata file from the local library as it is right now, irrespective of what it looked like in the past.
  * `snapshot.sources` stops `packrat` downloading the source files for all our dependencies. We're trusting CRAN to keep these available.
  * `infer.depenencies` is as in the previous step. We are in control and being explicit about what our dependencies are using `install.packages`.

### Commit and push snapshot

`packrat` has created/updated a number of files for us:
* `.gitignore` has had entries added to ignore the packages in the project-local library.
* `./packrat/packrat.lock` records versions of R and all the packages in the local library.
* `./packrat/packrat.opt` records our options choices. 
* `./.Rprofile` will initialise the `packrat` local library for a user starting an R session in this project. If they've just cloned it will be empty.
* `./packrat/init.R` is an automation script pointed to by `.Rprofile`

Interestingly, of these only `packrat.lock` is strictly required. A user can restore the project library given only this file. The other files make it a slightly smoother process, in that restoration is a single function call instead of two - but this comes at the cost of some potentially surprising automation.

I'm trying to keep my workflow lightweight so I only commit `./packrat/packrat.lock`. I add the others to my `.gitignore` - and make sure that is also committed.

### Restoring from a fresh clone

Assuming you committed `packrat.lock`, the local library can be restored with two function calls after opening an R session in a freshly cloned project directory:

```
> packrat::restore()
# Installing BH (1.69.0-1) ... 
#	OK (built source)
# Installing R6 (2.4.0) ... 
#	OK (built source)
# Installing RColorBrewer (1.1-2) ... 
#	OK (built source)
# Installing Rcpp (1.0.1) ... 
#	OK (built source)
# Installing assertthat (0.2.1) ... 
#	OK (built source)
# Installing backports (1.1.3) ... 
#	OK (built source)
# Installing base64enc (0.1-3) ... 
#	OK (built source)
# Installing clipr (0.5.0) ... 
#	OK (built source)
# ...

> packrat::init(infer.dependencies = FALSE,
              options = list(
                vcs.ignore.lib = TRUE,
                vcs.ignore.src = TRUE
              ))
# Initializing packrat project in directory:
# - "~/repos/packrat_demo"
# Initialization complete!
# Packrat mode on. Using library in directory:
# - "~/repos/packrat_demo/packrat/lib"            
```

If it's not clear, `packrat::restore()` downloads the libraries to `./packrat` and `packrat::init()` points our project there to look for it's dependencies.

I prefer to wrap these two up into a single file, `setup.R`, that the end user is instructed to `source` in the repo README. Obviously they need to have `packrat` installed to run that code, but I think the normal R error mechanisms that will trigger if they don't should be clear enough to see them through.

### Updating the library

As development progresses you will likely make changes to your project-local library. Remember to create a new snapshot and push the `packrat.lock` periodically. 

## What about wrapping packrat?

Initially I thought about wrapping up this workflow with a nicer API in a new package, maybe called `slackrat` or something, but then I remembered hearing that RStudio were working on a sequel to `packrat`: [`renv`](https://github.com/rstudio/renv) and it seems like they are proposing a very similar workflow. I am guessing this `renv` is a little ways off. We'll see if I break in the meantime.

## Packrat alternatives

`jetpack` looked really interesting and I had high hopes, but it is a bit new and rough around the edges for me.
* I did like that it uses a DESCRIPTION file to store package dependencies.
* I didn't like that it uses a different set of commands to install packages instead of `install.packages`.
* It gives very little feedback while working so I couldn't tell if it had hung or not when using its install functions.
* It has extremely scant documentation.

`checkpoint` was the first thing I tried and it sort of worked, but the problem is that it needs to be included in the project source to do its magic - and that magic needs to happen every time the project runs. So what I found was it clashes with `drake`, since in that workflow what you want to be doing is calling `make()` frequently to take advantage of the cache, but `checkpoint` would spend a significant amount of time searching through all the project files for dependencies each time `make()` is called. It just slowed the flow too much.

## Conclusion

Despite some awkwardness I found `packrat` still to be the best option for lightweight dependency management for R projects. Hopefully with `pak` and `renv` in development we'll see something similar but much less janky available soon. Good luck making your projects reproducible!
