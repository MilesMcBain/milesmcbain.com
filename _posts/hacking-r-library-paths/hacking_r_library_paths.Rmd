If you've been tripped up by R's library paths in the past, or you just enjoy a good hack, you might appreciate this little trick I discovered today. Here's an alternate to `.libPaths()` that will let you set your R library paths to precisely whatever you choose, whenever you like^[Unbelievably `libPaths()` doesn't let you remove your system or site library from the search path.]:

```r
set_lib_paths <- function(lib_vec) {

  lib_vec <- normalizePath(lib_vec, mustWork = TRUE)

  shim_fun <- .libPaths
  shim_env <- new.env(parent = environment(shim_fun))
  shim_env$.Library <- character()
  shim_env$.Library.site <- character()

  environment(shim_fun) <- shim_env
  shim_fun(lib_vec)

}

> .libPaths()
[1] "/home/miles/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.6"
[2] "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library"                
[3] "/usr/lib/R/site-library"                      
[4] "/usr/lib/R/library"    

> set_lib_paths("~/code/library")
> .libPaths()
[1] "/home/miles/code/library"
```

This code is inspired by some I found in the source of [Gabe Becker's `switchr` package](https://github.com/gmbecker/switchr/blob/682e0fe56ab1f3340856ff106767683058862c13/R/methods.R#L467). It looks a little cryptic, but when you figure out what's going on it's really quite exciting. 

So let's break it down:

According to the help of `.libPaths()` (which is a pretty 'classic' base R help file): 

> 
> If called with argument ‘new’, the library search path is set to the
> existing directories in ‘unique(c(new, .Library.site, .Library))’
> and this is returned.  If given no argument, a character vector
> with the currently active library trees is returned.

Which is to say `.libPaths(new)` will prepend your library paths, `.Library` and `.Library.site`, with whatever `new` contains. `.Library` and `.Library.site` are just regular R objects though. You can look up their values by typing them into your console. E.g. On my PC here:

```r
> .Library
[1] "/usr/lib/R/library"
```

So you might think (like I did), oh cool I can just overwrite these! Alas no. They don't appear in a regular environment e.g.:

```r
> environment(.Library)
NULL
```

And while you can assign to them, it doesn't affect the behaviour of `.libPaths()`. So we can deduce that `.libPaths()` must have access to some other environment that contains the versions of these objects it references.

On this assumption, what this function does is take a copy of the `.libPaths()` function and inject a shim environment between the copy and its original parent environment. Into the shim environment it injects new objects named `.Library` and `.Library.site` which are set to empty character vectors.

These injected objects mask the true versions that reside somewhere up the environment chain that we can't easily reach. So when the code in our copy of `.libPaths()` goes reaching for these objects it will find our empty copies first and its behaviour will now be to set our library paths to `c(new, character(0), character(0))` ...PHWARH!^[Importantly since we inserted our shim environment like a link into the existing chain, the `.libPaths()` code can still access any other objects it needs in higher scopes. Also the original `.libPaths()` works as normal]

Beyond this function, which could be incredibly useful in workshop/classroom settings, I'm quite taken with the environment shim technique. It'll be interesting to see what fun havok it can wreak with other people's package code. Can it facilitate a kind of [monkey-patching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch) of unexported functions? We'll see. Let me know if you use it for something gnarly!
