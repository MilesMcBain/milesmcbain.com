Even if you're not a massive input nerd, there's a pretty good chance you've heard about the [ZSA Moonlander Ergonomic Keyboard](). It's billed as the next generation of the much vaunted [ErgodoxEZ]() lineage, and like it's predecessor it carries an eye-watering price tag: USD $365.

This post is my review of this apex input device. I spent 60 days with it before giving up on it due to steadily worsening strain injuries in my hands. Despite the ergonomics being something of a critical failure for me, I did find a lot to like about it, especially on the configuration and customisation side of things. It came frustratingly close to a device I could really get excited about. 

The rest of this review is going to examine the these aspects of the board:

1. Quality
2. Portability
2. Tweakability
3. Ergonomics
4. Support Experience

From my perspective these represent the main selling points.

The Moonlander I ordered was the black version with Kailh Box Red (linear) switches:

# Quality

For the most part the Moonlander felt like a premium device. Its surfaces felt good under my hands. The key caps are subtly textured and ever so slightly grippy. They felt weighty and durable. They typing sounds were thick and substantial, without being excessively loud [^although a lot of this is due to my initial choice of a linear switch]. It gave a very tidy first impression.

I do have some nitpicks though:

The mechanism in the tenting legs felt flimsy. When rotating them I could feel a
gear clicking though a discrete set of positions, but the sound and feel of this
gave the impression that the gear was plastic. Unsettling metallic groans were
emitted from the springs on the allen screws when tightening them that made me
feel caution was required.


# Portability

This is an important one for me. I can't afford two Moonlanders, so I needed it
to be able accompany me in a bicycle pannier bag on my daily commute. Also
setting it up at the destination can't be a chore.

A big strike against the Moonlander in this regard is the lack of rigid case.
For a device in this price range it was a let down. What was provided wasn't
really a case so much as a thin neoprene slip that keeps the two halves, allen
key, and cables bundled together. It didn't seem like it would offers any
protection whatsoever from bumps during transit. By contrast my headphones,
which cost in the same ballpark as the Moonlander, shipped with a rigid zip-up
case.

After some careful measuring I was able to find exactly one reasonably priced rigid case for DJ headphones that would accept it, for which I paid AUD $40.

In its stock neoprene travel bundle, the board, cables, and allen key weighed in
at around a kilo. I didn't notice the weight on the bike, but you would in a
backpack, particularly since it is dense weight. Heavy enough to notice, not
heavy enough to be an issue I think.

The setup and tear down process does feel a bit cumbersome at first. The fit of
the allen key in the tenting screws was quite tight, so I found myself having to
concentrate to slot it in. Perhaps the most difficult thing to get down was that
the left thumb cluster screw is reverse threaded. "Lift-to-loosen" I found
myself muttering under my breath. It's the kind of thing you forget in hurry,
which I frequently am when trying to depart.

When packing up, the cables don't have a dedicated place to live in the neoprene slip which meant pack up always felt a bit haphazard. A couple of times I accidentally popped off a keycap trying to squeeze the cables into the slip along side one of the halves.

On the plus side, the wrist wrest folding mechanism is quite slick with a magnetic clasp that keeps them in travel mode. The wrist wrest hinge also gave a robust impression.

After I got the rigid case packing was greatly simplified. I started using the slip as padding only, and the case was sufficiently large that I could keep the tenting legs in my favoured position while stowing it.

So while I agree the Moonlander is portable, I don't think it's appreciably more
portable than a small keyboard (e.g. 60% form factor). Compared with other
ergonomic boards, it probably would be at the portable end, definitely more
portable than traditional offerings from Microsoft, Kinesis, et. al.

# Tweakability

This is where the Moonlander shone for me. The software side of things is incredibly well executed. There are two main ways you can customise the Moonlander's functionality: 

* You can use [online GUI editor called 'Oryx'](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/default/latest/0) which seems to be backed by `git`.
  Changes are incrementally tracked and you can fork a configuration at any
  point. Oryx is focused on the key map, but it does expose a subset of deeper
  stuff that is possible in the firmware.
* You can edit the Moonlander firmware directly in C code. It uses a framework
  called 'QMK'. ZSA provide instructions on how to get going with this, and QMK
  itself has some of the nicest documentation of any open source project that I
  have ever seen.

I didn't do anything too radical but the possibilities are expansive. To give a taste for what's possible:

I swapped out my shift keys for layer toggles. This meant I could directly control the 'shifted' version of each key. With this concept I:

* Made underscore, `_`, the shift of space.
* Swapped the locations of angle brackets `<`,`>` and parentheses `(`,`)`
* Made Lshift + Rshift `{`, with `}` on hold
* Made Rshift + Lshift `[`, with `]` on hold

The idea being to move symbols that I use regularly while working to more
convenient locations - and the results felt pretty damn good! This experience
has cemented for me that deep programmability is an important facet of truly
ergonomic hardware. All of us have different preferences and physical
limitations, too many and varied to design for in hardware!

One bonus in the Moonlander's favour is that QMK is an open source firmware that
is used by a variety of exotic keyboards including kit-builds. So experience
with QMK is likely to be portable to other boards, rather than being one
manufacturer's way of doing things.

I didn't get deep into QMK but I did work with it to set faster macros for
commonly used symbol combinations like `%>%` and `<-`, as well as playing with
the acceleration parameters of mouse control mode. This was all much easier than
I expected, thanks to the excellent docs. I found a Docker config for the QMK build environment that made building my changes a breeze.

One nitpick I'd make about tweaking that the iteration loop is quite slow for
continuous parameters. These underpin some important features, for example: How
long does a key need to be held down to register as a hold? How quick does a
double tap need to be? How fast should the mouse accelerate in mouse control
mode? The only way to set these is according to personal taste, but to change a
value means recompiling the firmware and re-flashing the board. It would be cool
if the board could provide some kind of shell that would accept commands
to alter these parameters live and feel the effects ^[This nitpick is minor since, I think within QMK it would definitely be possible to assign keys to increment and decrement these parameters live - it just would be nice to have a workflow for this out of the box.].

But nitpicks aside, the Moonlander was a tweaker's dream. I definitely want my next board to be running QMK.

However, there's a dark side to this which is tweaking can eat a lot of time,
and it was definitely tempting to try to make up for hardware that wasn't
working for me in software. I flashed the Moonlander a ton of times just trying
to find comfortable positions for some of my most important keys (escape, space,
control, backspace) since they were causing me pain when I had them on the thumb
cluster.

# Ergonomics

ZSA's marketing bills the Moonlanader as a "Next-generation ergonomic keyboard".
